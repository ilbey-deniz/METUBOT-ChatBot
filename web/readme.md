# metubot-web

## Project setup

First you need to install the dependencies:

```
cd backend; npm install; cd ../frontend; npm install;
```

Then you need to copy the backend/.env.example file to backend/.env and fill in the values. The real .env file is not
committed because it is dependent on the server and may contain classified information.

```

### Compiles the frontend and runs the backend/frontend bundle
```

cd backend; npm run serve

```
